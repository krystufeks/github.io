		<h3 id="Say-no-to-devil"><a href="#Say-no-to-devil" class="headerlink" title="Say no to devil"></a>Say no to devil</h3><p>I was walking up the Wenceslas square the other day when a drunk beggar got in my way. ‘‘Hey man, you look familiar, do I know you?’’<br>‘’No, you don’t!’’ I checked again and realized that it was Karel Gott himself.<br>‘’Man, what are you doing on the street like this?’’ He realized I recognised him and dragged me aside. ‘’Don’t speak so loud! The others wouldn’t let me stay here!’’.<br>‘’But how on Earth did you get here?’’<br>It turned out his young wife betrayed him when she threatened she would publish details about his deal with the communist regime in 1970. In order to protect his image, he preferred to give away his belongings and run away from the wife and potential leaks. He lives on the streets ever since then. Even though I felt little sorry for the poor man standing in front of me begging for his daily pint, I felt a big relief. Finally, someone is paying for having collaborated with the evil side of our history. Finally, this man sees that it didn’t pay off. Many famous singers of his era were silenced or forced out of the country, but he thrilled here and even managed to be popular in the west, a place many people could only dream of visiting. As he confided to me on that evening, this was due to a deal he had with the secret police - do not go against the regime, pretend life is great, hypnotize the masses and we will let you enjoy the stage big time.</p>
<p>Enjoy he did.<br>Masses were hypnotized.<br>The deal worked pretty well.</p>
<p>As you may have guessed this encounter did not actually happen. I’m even not sure I would like it to happen. But I’m fascinated that the population of this country is still hypnotized by the same guy after 50 years and counting. And even worse - most of the public discourse these days is occupied by Miloš Zeman - another mogul who succumbed to the lure and somehow cooperated with the regime. Yet another man of the dark past owns half of the country and is ready to become the next prime minister with his ‘’movement’’ that does not have a programme but is still winning most of the elections proclaiming they will simply do it.</p>
<p>It wasn’t only them. Most people got corrupted at the era, even if it was a little bit only. It was so hard to resist and so easy to grab the material advantages. Having full stomach and being able to drive to their cottage every weekend with Karel Gott on their radio, people and the whole nation were slowly giving up their souls. And it seems to me that they did not get it back again. Lying or pretending is still the standard way of getting forward. Shall we all end up as the beggar from the beginning of my story? Or shall we manage to get rid of the bad habits of the past? Luckily I already see members of my generation who understand the issue and try to do something about it. However, it is still not clear if it is enough to wait until those guys fade away or whether there is a way of taking this country from the hands of the likes of the ‘’Duke of Hluboká’’ or of the immortal creator of the miracle in Slusovice, recently elected senator. They seem to be riding on the wave recently. Fortunately, we have the brave members of the civic society fighting back in a constructive way these days. Will their drive be enough? Will they manage to unite? Will the enthusiasm beat the money? I still hope it does not pay off to play with the devil and those who did will have to give up. But the fight is not going to be easy.</p>
