How this will develop is yet to be defined. However, this is a significant step towards a united Europe, and experts are predicting that Bosnia could become a full member by 2025.</p>
<p>To join the EU, Bosnia needs to fulfill the Copenhagen Criteria, a set of rules that defines the eligibility of a country to join the Union. At the moment, Bosnia meets the geographic criteria and makes an enormous effort to accomplish the economic measures soon.</p>
<p>However, there is an important issue this country is facing; a crucial point for the European standards. Bosnia needs to fulfill its promises in the field of human rights, specifically in the area of women’s rights, and their political and labour representation.</p>
<p>In 2003, Bosnia introduced the Gender Equality Law, aiming at decreasing the differences between genders in politics, education and employment. However, 12 years later, according to the World Bank, the female participation in the job market is still frail. From all women aged 15 - 64, only 34% of females are employed, compared to 57% male employment, which is the lowest representation of women in the labour market in Europe.</p>
<p>In Bosnia and Herzegovina politics has stayed the male domain. (Sasa Gavric, SOC, 2015)</p>
<p>Ten years after the introducing the Gender Law, amendments to the Election Law were passed to ensure equal political representation. The necessary changes consisted of an introduction of a 40% quota of political representatives and minimum 40% ratio at the candidates list, both for the less represented gender. However, the elections in 2014 proved that the system is inefficient.</p>
<p>For instance, Party of Democratic Action (SDA), the largest Bosnian political party, received 110 seats, of which only 17 went to women. Another fact that shows the underrepresentation of women in politics is that in 2015 Canton governments elections, two cantons formed governments with no female ministers, even when aforementioned directly violated the Election Law.</p>
<p>For women in Bosnia, this is often not the primary concern, the main concern is that parties like SDA only mention women in their programmes concerning mothers and households. It is the same with the majority of other parties. Rarely parties support the improvement of parental leave support or benefits for single mothers. The latter is currently a critical issue in the country. There are no obligations for private companies to pay maternal leave, and it is up to a specific employer whether they will decide to pay it or not. The only women that receive the benefits work in the public sector, and this varies in different regions. For example, in Canton 10 in FBiH, you can get up to 100% of your wage while you won’t get anything in Posavina Canton, or you will get an equivalent of 200$ paid as a one-time assistance to all mothers in Herzegovina-Neretva Canton.</p>
<p>According to the Sarajevo Open Centre, in rural areas, women are often referred to as “helpers” or, in general, a passive part of the society. The central issue revolves around the fact that women do not own land and, thus, do not participate in the decision-making process. Even though this might refer to poor educational conditions in the country, the opposite has proven to be true. Women are very well educated throughout the country. According to the Statistics Agency of BiH, in 2014 women constituted 60.1% of the total number of college graduates constituted.</p>
<p>And still in this country with too many presidents, too many peacekeepers and the tenth highest consumption of coffee per capita, people like Darko Pandurevic, a law specialist for SOC, believe that the situation can change! The government has officially endorsed their positive, and trusting relationship with the European Union, and they work on the improvement of the human rights situation. Concrete measures taken into consideration are guided by CURE Foundacija, Sarajevo Open Centre and the Human Rights Ombudsman. Bosnia and Herzegovina might be one of the countries where a patriarchal system has always been in place, yet with the EU and its approach to the universality of human rights, there is a new hope for Bosnian women and their well-deserved equality.</p>
